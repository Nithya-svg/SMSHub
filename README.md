# SmartSMS 📱💬

**Python-Based SMS Management System**

SmartSMS is a **Python-based mini project** that demonstrates how SMS-related operations such as message handling, automation, or analysis can be implemented using Python. The project includes both a **Python script** and a **Jupyter Notebook**, making it suitable for learning, experimentation, and academic evaluation.

This project helps students understand how Python can be used to build simple communication-related applications or analyze SMS data.

## 🎯 Objective

The main objectives of this project are to:

* Understand SMS-based application workflows
* Implement SMS logic using Python
* Explore automation or analysis through scripting and notebooks
* Gain hands-on experience with real-world style applications

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas (if data handling is used)
* NumPy (Naive Bayes theorem)
* SMS API / simulation logic *(if applicable)*

---

## 📌 Features

* Python script for SMS functionality
* Jupyter notebook for experimentation and analysis
* Simple and beginner-friendly design
* Easy to modify and extend
* Suitable for learning and demonstrations

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nithya-svg/SMS-.git
cd SMS-
```

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas numpy jupyter
```

*(Install additional libraries if used in the code)*

---

### Step 3: Run the Python Script

```bash
python "app (1).py"
```

---

### Step 4: Run the Jupyter Notebook (Optional)

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open:

```
project2.ipynb
```

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle

* The main Python file contains the core SMS-related logic
* The Jupyter notebook is used for testing, analysis, or experimentation
* Inputs are processed using Python logic or data-handling techniques
* Output is displayed in the console or notebook interface

---

## 🧪 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Internet connection *(if SMS APIs are used)*
